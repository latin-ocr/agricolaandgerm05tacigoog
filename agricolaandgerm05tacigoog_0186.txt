overwhelming strength. Notto speak of the extreme awkward-
ness of its position. and of the improbability that Tacitus should
trouble himself to tell ns what the Germane did not do, or did

should be in dhect contradiction to Caesar who says oxpreesly,
B. 0. vr. π, that the Germane pass their whole lile in the
chase and the ursuits einer. Itis, besides, utterly improbable
theta wild and warlilre peopls (as Tacitus describes the Germane
to have been) should heve been indifferent to the chose.
