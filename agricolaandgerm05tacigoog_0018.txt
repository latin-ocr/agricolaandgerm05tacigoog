WRJPJNGS OF rnolr‘t's xiii
August 23, nn. 93. (See Apr. cb. 15). It is certain,

however, that he was in Rome during tbe last period of
Domitian’s reign. The languaga in which at tho close
of the Agricola he describes the horrors of that time is
full of tbe bitterness, and even of the aelf-reproaclr of
one who bad been compelled to witness and to sanction
by his presence tho oruelties of tha tyrant

Domitian was assassinatad Sept 18, an. 95. Two
years afterwards Tacitus was advanoed to the dignity
of the Consulship. Verginius Rufus had died in his
year of office, and Tacitus was appointed to succeed
him. He ulso delivered a funeral oration on his pre·
deressor. ‘⁶ Hic supremos,'' says Pliny of Rufus
(Epist. 11. l), “ felicitati ejus cumulus accessit, laudator
eloquentissimus? =

In nn. 100 he was appointed together with Pliny,-
who was then Consul elect, to conduct the impeaoh·
ment preferred bytho Province of Africa against their
late Proconsul, Marcus Priscus. Pliny, who relates
the trial at length (Epist. 11. 11), describes his oratory
by the epithet σεμνῶς. Here the public life of Tacitis
terminated. We hear indeed in one of Pliny's letters
(vn 9) of his interesting himself in the candidature of
one Julius Naso for some public office. We may gu·
ther from the letter that he was not then 'living at
Rome, and, perhaps, as he was not aware that Naso
had started under the auspices of Pliny, that he lrnew
but little of what was going on in the capital.

The date of his death is not known, but that he at
least lived down to the end of Trajan's reign, we may
infer from aaa. 11. 61, where he says that the Roman
Empire “ Nunc ad rubrum mare patescit,” an expres·
sion which must referto the successes obtained by
Trajan in his Eastern expedition (an. 114-1 17).
