24· Eo laudis excedere] ‘Rite to that degree or dis·

¹ tinction.’ ‘Excedere’ denotes the trauseending ordinary limita

Lipsius needlessly conjectured ‘escendere’

25· Per abrupta] ‘By steep (and, consequently‚ danger-
ous) patha! The meaning oi the phrase is explained and illus-
trated by a passage in Aac. lv. so, an liceat inter abruptam con·
tumaoiam et deforme obsequium pergere iter ambitione ao peri·
culis vacuum. The notion oi ‘abrupta contumacia' as here of

e· Vulgus ethic aliud agens populus] No manee
distinction ia intended between calyce and popalus. Both word·

denote the lowest and poorest class, as in Diolop. 7, culpus im·
peritum et tunicatus hic populus (tunicatus meaning those who
were too poor ιο wear the ‘toga' comp.Hor.E1p. 1. 7, 65, tursi-
σοι) popello) and as in Hier. 1. 89, culpare et magnitudine nimia
communium curarum expers popular. comp. also Hist. 11. 90,
melpsa suarum curis. These passages explain and illustrate the
meaning of ‘aliud (Μ’ which implies inattentiou and indiffer-
