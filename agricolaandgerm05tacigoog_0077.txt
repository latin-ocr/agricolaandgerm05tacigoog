6· Ronmanorum] ‘romengeographyss
7. Sp‘atio ac coelo, etc] ‘Spatium' means ‘exterit'

‘coelum geographical position,' as astronomically and scienti· ·
fically determined. There is a reference ιο the digision ol the
earth into nones. It seems that Tacitus (in common with other
writers) believed both Spain and Germany to extend much fur·
ther to the north than they actually do. · On this supposition his
meaning in this sentence would be that Britain lies opposite ιο
Spain on the west, to Germany ou the east, and ιο Gaul on the
south ; but that in the two former cases the distance is so con·
siderable that the fact has to be inferred lromcertain considera·
tions (expressed by the words spatio ac coelo), whereas in the case
of Gaul it was a matter of ocular demonstration, Gallis etiam
inspicitur. It will be remembered that Tacitus included Scandi-
navia in what he called Germany. ’

9· Oblongae scutulae, etc] It is not carto see what
conception Tacitus had formed. ol the shape ol Butam. He

seems to have shared the passion for discovering resemblances
common ιο the ancient geographers. It has been doubted whe-
ther scotum means a ‘dish,’ or a mathematical flgure3 and,
takIng the later supposition, whether it signifies a rhombus, a
rhomboid, or a trapezium. We incline ιο the latter opinion,
andmay imagine the southern shore to be the longest eide oi
the trapezium. The opposite or northern bcundary would be
the shortest. This figure would bear some resemblance tc the
bipennis, if we suppose the οἴνοιο baad only of that weapon to be
intended. But from this northern boundary, which one niight
have supposed ιο be the extreme limit of the country (mtremo jam
littore) there extended a vast projection, narrowing in a wedge·
like shape (in cuneum). Excluding Caledonia (citra Caledoniam)
the country was like a scutulo or bipennis

10. In universum tame est transgressa] The MSS·
favour the reading ‘in universum‚’ which the sense seems ιο

demand. Because this resemblance is real as ιο part of the
island, ithae been supposed to be so about the whole. ‘Uni-
versis‚' which Orelli reads, and which heintcrprets in this way,
can hardly bear such a meaning. Kritz reads ‘transgressis'
which be takes ιο mean ‘among those who have crosssd over
[from the continent into Britain].’ This strikes us as a very
questionable rendering.
