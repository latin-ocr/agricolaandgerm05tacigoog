Paulinus (Agr. 5) However this may be, itis cer· ‘
tuin thet at or before· this time an intimate acquaint- ³

anea had been formed between the two men. In

an. 77 Agricola returned to Remoto fulfil the duties ¹

of the Consulship. During his year cf office he
betrothed his daughter (bern nn. 65) to his young
friend„ Juvat anili, says Tacitus, filiam despondit.
Juvenr's, like other Latin terme denoting age, is

of Tribuna of the People, which, as Titus died Sept 13,
nn. 81, he must have held either A n. 80 or in the

(Aba xr. 11) that he was Praetor An. 88, in which

year Domitian celebrated the Ludi Saeculares. In 89
or 90 he left Rome with his wife, and did not return
