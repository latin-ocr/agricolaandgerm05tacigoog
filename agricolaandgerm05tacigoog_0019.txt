xiv NOTES ΟΝ THE LIFE AND

The Dialogus de Oratore, which we have no hositse
tion in ascribing to the pen of Tacitus, was probably
an early worle The expression which ,we find in oh. 17,
“sextam jam felicis hujus principatus stationem 'qua
Vespasianus rempublicam fovet,” may not be intended
to do more than fix thc date of the imaginary conver·

The Agricola was publishod towards· the close of
an. 97 3 the &among in tho following year. 1116

cation of the Arcucis must bo referred, as has before
been said, to the close of Trajan's reign. Reference is
made in 'Aua 11. 11 to the Hectoras as an earlier work,
“libris quibus, res Domitiani imperatoris composui.''
'l'he two contained together thirty books, as w'e learn

from S. Jcrome on Zachariah, ch. x111.,and related the χ

events of about ’70 years from the death of Augustus
to the accession of Nerva It is probable that Tacitus
found it expedient to abendon tho intention, an-

reigns of Nerva and Trajan. The records of an extinot
