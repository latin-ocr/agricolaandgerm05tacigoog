¹ · 11. Nam sicuti...0minabatur,] Ritter’s emendationes

this passage (which he accomplhshes by substituting quondam ior
qnod) appears to be the simplest, and we have (with Kritz) adopted
it. We think too Kritz is right in reading hanc lucem for hac
lnce, as this is the regular construction with durare. There is, it
must be admitted, considerable difficulty about the expression
‘durare ominabatur,' which may however be compared with a
passage in Hiet. 1. 50, erant qui Vespasianum et arma Orientis
ariarate irreserabiliter
tiss. According ιο Dio, nxrx. ro (and Plin. Paaeg.·5, 94),
Trajan’s elevatior was foretold two years before Agricolas's death,
and to this Tacitus perhaps refers in ‘augurio’ Or we may
render ‘Trajanum’ by our expression ‘a Trajan! ‘Augurio
votisque ominabatnr’ isequivalent to ‘augurabatur et sehe-
menter optabat?
