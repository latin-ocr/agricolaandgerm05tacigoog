TO THE ‘ GERMANIA! 111

inaccusata, and he now and then seems te attribute te
the whole German population the peculiarities oi a
single peeple On the whole, however, there can be
little doubt but that his work may be accepted as that
ef a sagacieus thinker and painstaking inquiner. He
has contrived to compress inte a small eompass much
really valuable matter, and has enabled ns te peroeive
in their earliest werlinge the germs of certain medi„

presented by the domestic virtues of the Germane te
the corruption and profligaoy of his eountrymen, and
he continnally avails himself ef it te point the satire

evident from the eminens language st the close ef
ch 33, that there was danger te the empire from the
side of Germany. But neither was his admiration of
the Germane by any means unqualified‚ as is clearly

thing to imply thet he secred the worst fer his coun-

try. On the contrary, the suspicions opening of
Nerva's reign, and the increasing strength and pros-

spired him with new saith in the destinies of
Rome.
