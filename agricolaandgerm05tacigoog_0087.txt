58 · CORNELII TAOITI AGRICOLA

in meaning tc alius, aud it cemainly is unlikely that Tacitus would
even suggest a comparieon between Cerialis and Agricola, as by
this interpretation he is made to de. For the expression ‘curam
famamque obruisset’ comp. Oh. 46, multos veterum oblivio cheud.
(obruisset' (would have completely extinguished) is astrongen
word than obscurasset, by which it has been explained. By
1‘ molem' we are to understand the difficulty ol the work imposed
ou Frontinus, who had to complete what 'Cerialis had so ably¹
begun. Gomp. its use Aac. L 45, haud minor neela supererat
ob ferociam quintae et vicesimae legionis; Hist. 111. 46, ne ex·
t'erna nacha utrimque ingrueret. There remeius some 'difficulty
about the words ‘quantum hostat! Their collocation seems to
require that they should be construed with ‘vir ·magnus,'
though Wex and Kritz take them with ‘sustinuit molem,' under·
standing them to mean that Frontinus, so far as the difficulties
ol his position permitted, carried out the arduous taslr which
devolved on him. lt is possible however that Tacitus, although
in this ‘very chapter he has admitted that under Vespasian there
were ‘magni duces,’ may be hinting at that Emperor’s well-known
thiathaldi&litii titiisttltttttsstlt
that an imperial regines is sure to eet limite on greatness. Julius
Frontinus had been praeter urbanus. He was probably at this
time apraetorian legatus in Britain, and seems to have com·
manded a legion in a different part of the countryfrom that where
tbe operatione oi Cerialis had been conducted. He was the
author oi two works which have come down to ue, one on mili·
tary stratagema, the other, on aqueducts. Pliny (Ep. 1v. 8, 3),
speaks ol him iu high terme.
