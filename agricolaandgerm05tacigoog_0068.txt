⁸3· quae equestris nobilitas eet] There is some
‹hffioulty about these words. Wex oonsiders thern ιο ιι spurious

thougirt to have aotod strangely when he aooo ted a Procurator·

hand, affirma that tha office was bestowed only on the moro dis·
tinguished members oi the equestriau order. If the words are
