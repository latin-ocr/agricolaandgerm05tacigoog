strains too much after effect, he is on the whole a far
more natural and straightforward writer than most
ol his contemporaries.

It hos been usual to regard (licere as the repre·
tentative ot* the most perfect Latinity, and Tacitus as
a man oi genius belonging to a deelining age and in-
fected by many of its chief literary vices This view
ignores several important consideratione and requires
some correction It is true that the style of (licere,
from its general conformity ιο certain precise and
definite rules, is fitted ιο be a model ol Latinity in a
sense in which that of Tacitus cannot he A modom

scholar feels instinctively that the first is much more
suitable for imitation, but it is, we think, a great mis-
take to claim on this ground for Cicero a distinct supe
1iority orer Tacitus (licere indeed was enabled by his
great abilities and wide culture ιο give a richness and
llexibility to the Latin langnoge which it had not
known before his time, and we may venture te affirm

that without him there could not hare been a Tacitae. r

If, however, we are ιο measure excellence of style by
its capacity of adequately representing the profound and
subtle ideas of a really great thinker, we shall see good
reason for placing Tacitus in at least as high a rank as
(licere. In vividness of imagination, in insight into

’ · the intrieacies of human character, in tho breadth and

comprehensiveness of his historical faculty, he stands
first among Roman writers. These qualities are eon-
tinually reflected in his style. In the language of the
time, permeated as it was with Greek ideas and
phrases, he found an instrument ready toliis hand;
he used it with a consummato mastery oi its various
resources, and succeeded in giving to great thoughts a
singularly characteristic expression.
