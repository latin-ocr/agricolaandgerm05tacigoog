read ‘ut iugere' with Kritz, or take ‘fugere oovinnarii’ with
Ritter, as parenthetioally introduced, whioh seems exoeedingly
awkward, and improbable. In this ease ‘equitum turmae’ would
no doubt be ideatioal with the 3000 cavalry which, aa appears
nom ch. 35, were posted on the wings oi the Reman army. The
word ‘turmae' (a teobnieal military term) would oertainly seem
to point to a Raram ratber than to any other iores. It is, how-

may be eorreot. Itis not satisiaetory‚ but other explanations
