NOTES. 71

5. Laeuo] These ‘lakes' (now known as the Znyderaee)
are continunlly mentioned in the account of the campaigns of
Germanicus See Ana 1. 60. 63. 7ο and11. 8. The “iossaDru-
siana'’ (Aac. 11. 8), which united the Rhine and Yssel, opened
a communication with the laires in question.

6. Druso Germanico] It seems better to 'take this with
Orelli ofrDrnsua alone, the father oi Germanicus, than with
Kritz ol both the father and the eon. Such an asyndeton would
be needlessly harah and obscure, aa RItter, who inserts cc, has

’ noticed. Drusus is spoken ci, Hcs. v. 19, astsns Germanicum.

His son was not sc much an explorer ss an avenger ol the defeat
of Vama. This makes Orelli's view the more probable. The

following words (Mox nemo tentavit), which seem to contradict
it, must be understood ul exploring expeditione rather than ol
ordinary campaigns.

Chauci into majores and minores, and makes the Visurgis (Weser)

this distinction (missis qui majores Chaucos ad deditionempelli·

the Weser and the Elbe, the minores between the Weser and the
